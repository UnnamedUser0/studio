/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Hermosillo Pizza Finder App.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and reviews, while providing public read access to pizzeria and testimonial data. Administrative privileges are granted based on the existence of a document in the /roles_admin collection. All write operations are strictly controlled based on authentication and role.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data, accessible only to the authenticated user with matching UID.
 * - /pizzerias/{pizzeriaId}: Stores pizzeria data, publicly readable but writable only by admins.
 * - /pizzerias/{pizzeriaId}/reviews/{reviewId}: Stores reviews for pizzerias, with ownership tied to the user who created the review.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Documents in this collection indicate admin privileges for the corresponding user.
 * - /testimonials/{testimonialId}: Stores user testimonials, publicly readable and writable by authenticated users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Pizzeria and testimonial data is publicly readable.
 * - Admin privileges are determined by the existence of a document in /roles_admin/{userId}.
 * - Reviews are secured to ensure that a review can only be created, updated, or deleted by the user who created it or an admin.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `isAdmin` property is denormalized to avoid costly `get()` calls for checking admin status. The presence of a document in `/roles_admin/{userId}` indicates admin privileges.
